# Simon-Says-Game
A simple Simon Says game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game challenges users to remember and repeat a sequence of flashing colors. As the levels progress, the sequence becomes longer, increasing the difficulty. The project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling techniques.
